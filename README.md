# WeatherApp

This is a small weather App that I built over winter break to get hands on experience with working with ReactJs. In this mini project the app asks for a location to enter. Once you enter the location it gives you the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity levels. All this information is grabbed from the open weather map api.
